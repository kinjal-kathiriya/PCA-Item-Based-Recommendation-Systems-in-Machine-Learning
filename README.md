# 📊 PCA-Based Image Clustering & Item-Based Joke Recommendation  
Machine Learning — Assignment 4  

This project focuses on two major machine learning tasks:

1. **Image Segmentation Clustering using PCA + KMeans**  
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering for Joke Recommendation**

It involves dimensionality reduction, similarity metrics, clustering evaluation, and building both memory-based and model-based recommendation algorithms.
